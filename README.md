Quiz app for the #7DaysofCodeChallenge by Udoh Faith Edima (faithudoh71@gmail.com)


Brief Description: I developed an educational app that quizzes a user about different topics. I achieved this by implementing what I learned in the Android Basics Course. The app includes at least four of the following Views: TextView, ImageView, Button, Checkbox, EditText, LinearLayout, RelativeLayout, ScrollView, RadioButton, RadioGroup. It also contains 4 quiz questions.
